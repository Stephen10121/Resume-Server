# Resume-Server

This is for my resume.

For some reason I am also using this to control my arduino projects.

```
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
```

dont forget to make a password.txt file with a sha256 hashed password.
Hash you password with this website:
```
https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html
```
paste what you got in the output into the password.txt file.
password.txt loaction: "clone path"/Resume-Server/password.txt
